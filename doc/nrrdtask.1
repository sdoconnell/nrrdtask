nrrdtask - Terminal-based task management for nerds.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]nrrdtask\f[R] \f[I]command\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]nrrdtask\f[R] is a terminal-based task management program with
advanced search options, formatted output, and task data stored in local
text files.
It can be run in either of two modes: command-line or interactive shell.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]\[en]help\f[R]
Display help information.
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R], \f[B]\[en]config\f[R] \f[I]file\f[R]

.PP
\f[B]nrrdtask\f[R] provides the following commands.
.TP
\f[B]archive\f[R] \f[I]alias\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]]
Move a task to the archive directory of your data directory (by default,
$HOME/.local/share/nrrdtask/archive).

Notes to add to the task.
Be sure to properly escape the text if it includes special characters or
newlines that may be interpretted by the shell.
Using this option, any existing notes on the task will be replaced.
This command option is included mainly for the purpose of automated note
insertion (i.e., via script or command).
For more reliable note editing, use the \f[B]notes\f[R] command.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]parent\f[R] \f[I]alias\f[R]

Priority is defined as \f[I]high\f[R], \f[I]medium\f[R],
\f[I]normal\f[R], and \f[I]low\f[R].
Thresholds for these values are defined by the following configuration
options: \f[I]priority_high\f[R], \f[I]priority_medium\f[R], and
\f[I]priority_normal\f[R].
A priority is defined by the following expression:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
HIGH <= priority_high < MEDIUM <= priority_medium < NORMAL <= priority_normal < LOW
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If color is enabled, task priority is color-coded.

.RE
.TP
\f[B]\[en]tags\f[R] \f[I]tag[,tag]\f[R]
Tags assigned to the task.
This can be a single tag or multiple tags in a comma-delimited list.
Normally with this option, any existing tags assigned to the task will
be replaced.
However, this option also supports two special operators: \f[B]+\f[R]
(add a tag to the existing tags) and \f[B]\[ti]\f[R] (remove a tag from
the existing tags).
For example, \f[I]\[en]tags +documentation\f[R] will add the
\f[I]documentation\f[R] tag to the existing tags on a task, and
\f[I]\[en]tags \[ti]testing,experimental\f[R] will remove both the
\f[I]testing\f[R] and \f[I]experimental\f[R] tags from a task.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]add-reminder\f[R] <\f[I]YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\f[R] | \f[I]expression\f[R]> \f[I]notification\f[R]
Add a reminder to a task.
The reminder can be defined as a specific date and time, or as a
relative expression:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
start+/-[Xd][Yh][Zm] : a reminder relative to \f[I]start\f[R].
E.g., `start-15m' triggers a reminder 15 minutes before the
\f[I]start\f[R] datetime.
.IP \[bu] 2
due+/-[Xd][Yh][Zm] : a reminder relative to \f[I]due\f[R].
E.g., `due+1h' triggers a reminder 1 hour after the \f[I]due\f[R]
datetime.
.PP
The \f[I]notification\f[R] can be one of \f[I]display\f[R] or
\f[I]email\f[R].
A \f[I]display\f[R] notification will trigger a desktop notification and
an \f[I]email\f[R] notification will cause a reminder email to be sent.
\f[B]NOTE\f[R]: \f[B]nrrdtask\f[R] itself does not send reminders, but
produces a JSON-formatted list of reminder triggers and notification
types using the \f[B]reminders\f[R] command.
The output of \f[B]reminders\f[R] can be parsed by an application such
as \f[B]nrrdalrt\f[R] which will produce the notifications.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\[en]del-reminder\f[R] \f[I]index\f[R]

.SH NOTES
.SS Archiving a task
.PP
Use the \f[B]archive\f[R] subcommand to move the task file to the
subdirectory archive in the the tasks data directory.
Confirmation will be required for this operation unless the
\f[I]\[en]force\f[R] option is also used.
.PP
Archived tasks will no longer appear in lists of tasks (\f[I]done\f[R]
or otherwise).
This can be useful for retaining completed tasks without resulting in
endlessly growing task lists.
To review archived tasks, create an alterate config file with a
\f[I]data_dir\f[R] pointing to the archive folder, and an alias such as:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
alias nrrdtask-archive=\[dq]nrrdtask -c $HOME/.config/nrrdtask/config.archive\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NOTE:\f[R] If you archive a task that has subtasks, the subtasks
will also be archived.
.SS Task recurrence
.PP
Tasks may have a recurrence rule (using the \f[B]\[en]rrule\f[R] option
to \f[B]new\f[R] and \f[B]modify\f[R]) to express that the task repeats
or occurs more than once.
The \f[I]rrule\f[R] is a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs.
.PP
The supported keys are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- date= : (str) specific recurrence date/times, delimited by comma (,).
- except= : (str) specific date/times to be excluded, delimited by comma (,).
- freq= : (str) one of minutely, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- count= : (int) a specific number of recurrences.
- until= : (str) recur until this date/time.
- interval= : (int) the interval of recurrence.
- byhour= : (int) recur by hour (0-23).
- byweekday= : (str) one or more (comma-delimited) of SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, or SA.
- bymonth= : (int) recur by month (1-12).
- bymonthday= : (int) recur by day of month (1-31).
- byyearday= : (int) recur by day of the year (1-366).
- byweekno= : (int) recur by week of year (1-53).
- bysetpos= : (int) the position in an occurence set (e.g., 1 for first, -1 for last, -2 for second to last).
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
For example, a task that recurs on the last Monday of the month until
December 31, 2021 would have the following rrule:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
freq=monthly;byweekday=MO;bysetpos=-1;until=2021-12-31
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NOTE:\f[R] ensure to properly escape or quote `;' in recurrence
rules when using the \[en]rrule option on the command line.
.PP
A task MUST have both a \f[I]start\f[R] date/time and an \f[I]rrule\f[R]
to be considered a recurring task.
A task with an \f[I]rrule\f[R] and no \f[I]start\f[R] will be treated as
a regular task.
.SS How repeating tasks work
.PP
Only one active (non-`done') instance of a repeating task will appear in
the task list at any given time.
When the \f[I]status\f[R] of a repeating task is set to `done' or
`cancelled', \f[B]nrrdtask\f[R] will clone the task into a new task with
a \f[I]status\f[R] of `todo', and `start' and `due' set to the next
occurrence date and relative due date (if any).
Other progress fields (e.g., \f[I]started\f[R], \f[I]completed\f[R],
\f[I]percent\f[R], etc.)
will be reset.
Completed recurring tasks remain in history and exist in the
\f[I]data_dir\f[R] like any other task.
.SS Search and query
.PP
There are two command-line methods for filtering the presented list of
tasks: \f[B]search\f[R] and \f[B]query\f[R].
These two similar-sounding functions perform very different roles.
.PP
Search results are output in the same tabular, human-readable format as
that of \f[B]list\f[R].
Query results are presented in the form of tab-delimited text (by
default) or JSON (if using the \f[I]-j\f[R] or \f[I]\[en]json\f[R]
option) and are primarily intended for use by other programs that are
able to consume structured text output.
.PP
\f[B]search\f[R] and \f[B]query\f[R] use the same filter syntax.
The most basic form of filtering is to simply search for a keyword or
string in the task description:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search <search_term>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NOTE:\f[R] search terms are case-insensitive.
.PP
If the search term is present in the task \f[I]description\f[R], the
task will be displayed.
.PP
Optionally, a search type may be specified.
The search type may be one of \f[I]uid\f[R], \f[I]alias\f[R],
\f[I]description\f[R], \f[I]location\f[R], \f[I]tags\f[R],
\f[I]status\f[R], \f[I]parent\f[R], \f[I]priority\f[R],
\f[I]percent\f[R], \f[I]project\f[R], \f[I]start\f[R], \f[I]due\f[R],
\f[I]started\f[R], \f[I]completed\f[R], or \f[I]notes\f[R].
If an invalid search type is provided, the search type will default to
\f[I]description\f[R].
To specify a search type, use the format:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search [search_type=]<search_term>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You may combine search types in a comma-delimited structure.
All search criteria must be met to return a result.
.PP
The tags search type may also use the optional \f[B]+\f[R] operator to
search for more than one tag.
Any matched tag will return a result.
.PP
The special search term \f[I]any\f[R] can be used to match all tasks,
but is only useful in combination with an exclusion to match all records
except those excluded.
.SS Exclusion
.PP
In addition to the search term, an exclusion term may be provided.
Any match in the exclusion term will negate a match in the search term.
An exclusion term is formatted in the same manner as the search term,
must follow the search term, and must be denoted using the \f[B]%\f[R]
operator:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search [search_type=]<search_term>%[exclusion_type=]<exclusion_term>
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Search examples
.PP
Search for any task description with the word \[lq]projectx\[rq]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search projectx
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Search for any tasks due 2021-11-15:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search due=2021-11-15
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Search for all tasks tagged \[lq]development\[rq] or \[lq]testing\[rq]
with a status of \[lq]inprogess\[rq] and a priority of 1-3, except for
those that are 95% or more complete:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
nrrdtask search status=inprogress,priority=\[ti]3,tags=development+testing%percent=95\[ti]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Query and limit
.PP
The query function uses the same syntax as search but will output
information in a form that may be read by other programs.
The standard fields returned by query for tab-delimited output are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- uid (string)
- alias (string)
- status (string)
- priority (string)
- description (string)
- location (string)
- project (string)
- percent (string)
- tags (list)
- parent (string)
- start (string)
- due (string)
- started (string)
- completed (string)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List fields are returned in standard Python format: [`item 1', `item 2',
\&...].
Empty lists are returned as [].
Empty string fields will appear as multiple tabs.
.PP
JSON output returns all fields for a record, including fields not
provided in tab-delimited output.
.PP
The query function may also use the \f[B]\[en]limit\f[R] (\f[B]-l\f[R])
option.
This is a comma-separated list of fields to return.
The \f[B]\[en]limit\f[R] option does not have an effect on JSON output.
.SS Paging
.PP
Output from \f[B]list\f[R], \f[B]search\f[R], and \f[B]info\f[R] can get
long and run past your terminal buffer.
You may use the \f[B]-p\f[R], \f[B]\[en]page\f[R] option in conjunction
with search, list, or info to page output.
